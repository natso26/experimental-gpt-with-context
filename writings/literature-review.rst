Literature review
=================

CoT, ReAct, ToT
---------------

LLMs are fundamentally reactive, but there are techniques to compensate.

- CoT: https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903; suggests including intermediate thinking steps.
- ReAct: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629; suggests providing reasoning before acting.
- ToT: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601; suggests orchestrating with tree search.


Tool uses
---------

Many variations.

- FLARE: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06983; suggests retrieving information when unconfident.


Autonomous agents
-----------------

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11432; survey.


Misc
----

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09009; suggests prompts are unstable across models.
- Contrastive decoding: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09117; suggests contrasting with weaker models can improve performance.


Philosophy
----------

- Searle's Chinese Room invites us to think about how intelligence can emerge from composition of weaker intelligence.
